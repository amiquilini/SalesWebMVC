# SalesWebMVC
Udemy/NelioAlves - C# Course Project - ASP.NET Core 2.1

- This is a WEB Application using ASP.NET Core MVC to simulate a Store system. 
- In this application, it is possible to register/modify new departments, sellers and sales. 
- Also, it is possible to search for sales registered in a given time.
- DB connection was made locally with MySQL.

> Ps. The project proposed in the course did not cover registration of new sales, which were added as an extra feature. Also, a customized Home Page will still be implemented.
